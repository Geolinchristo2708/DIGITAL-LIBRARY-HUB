 Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph traversal and shortest path 
finding algorithm used in computer science and network 
routing. Here's how it plays a role in a DSA (Data 
Structures and Algorithms) map navigator project in about 
four key points:
SHORTEST PATH
CALCULATION:
Dijkstra's algorithm is employed
to find the shortest path between
two locations on a map. It
calculates the minimum distance
from a starting point to all other
points in the graph, effectively
creating a map of the shortest
paths.
WEIGHTED GRAPH
REPRESENTATION:
 In the map navigator project,
locations are represented as nodes,
and the connections between them
(roads, for example) are
represented as edges with
associated weights (usually distance
or travel time). Dijkstra's algorithm
works on weighted graphs, making it
suitable for finding the optimal
routes.
REAL-TIME NAVIGATION:
Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to
provide real-time navigation
guidance. As a user inputs their
current location and destination, the
algorithm computes the shortest
path, considering the current state
of the road network, and provides
turn-by-turn directions.
