The Round Robin algorithm is employed to ensure that every student query receives
equal processing time. Here's an outline of the algorithm's implementation in our
system:
Queries are stored in a queue data structure.
Each query is assigned a time quantum for processing.
The system processes queries in a cyclic manner, allocating a time quantum to
each query in a round-robin fashion.
If a query is not resolved within its allocated time quantum, it is moved to the end of
the queue to be processed in the next cycle.
Data Structures and Logic:
The system maintains a queue to hold incoming student queries. When a query
arrives, it is added to the end of the queue.
 The system's processor iterates through the queue, allocating time to
 each query
 Once a query's time quantum expires, it is moved to the end of the queue
 for further processing.
